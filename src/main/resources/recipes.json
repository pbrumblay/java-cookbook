        "Instructions":"Note: The soup spoons used in the amounts above are Asian soup spoons -- which hold quite a bit more than Western soup spoons. Go to a chinese restaurant to see what I'm talking about .\r\n\r\n1. Heat water almost to boiling in large bowl. This will be used to wet rice paper when making rolls.\r\n2. Put ground pork in big mixing bowl.\r\n3. Boil bean thread, strain, cut into manageable lengths, add to bowl.\r\n4. Soak black fungus in boiling water, strain, cut into manageable lengths, add to bowl.\r\n5. Chop onions and green onions (2/3 the way up), add to bowl.\r\n6. Add oyster sauce, pepper, sugar, salt, cornstarch mixture, eggs.\r\n7. Knead mixture in bowl until even.\r\n8. Wet the rice paper in the hot water (from step 1). Once it becomes pliable but not too sticky, fold 1/3 of paper down. This gives the roll a thicker area to spread the meat mixture on.\r\n9. Place meat mixture on folded rice paper, spread so that there is 1 inch of space on each of the ends. \r\n10. Fold the ends of the rice paper on top of the meat mixture.\r\n11. Roll it up, pulling the roll if necessary to make a firm wrap.\r\n12. Repeat steps 8 through 11 until all rice paper or meat mixture is gone.\r\n13. Poke rolls with toothpick liberally (this prevents them from blowing up in the fryer).\r\n14. Fry rolls in deep fryer at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until fryer is noticeably quieter (the water will have been cooked off – the water is what makes the fryer loud!).\r\n",

Over low heat, add wine and sour cream, stirring until well combined.  Add beef;  simmer until sauce and beef are hot.  Serve with cooked noodles.  \r\n\r\nNote:  I use Campbell's beef broth",

Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.\r\n\r\nDiscard the oil in the skillet, then wipe out the skillet with a paper towel.  Set over medium heat and add the butter.  When it is melted, add the shallots and garlic and saute until aromatic but not browned, about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nRemove the skillet from the heat and add the brandy; be careful here, because the brandy may ignite.  Add the cream and mustard to the skillet and return the skillet to the heat, increasing the heat to high.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.  Return the chops to the skillet, along with any accumulated juices, and simmer until the sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon and the chops are just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn the chops in the sauce once as they cook.\r\n\r\nRemove the skillet from the heat and season the chops with the lemon juice and salt and pepper.  Transfer the chops to a serving platter, spoon sauce over them, and serve immediately, sprinkled with the chopped fresh herbs.\r\n\r\nNote:  You can substitute milk for the cream.

Scatter muffin cubes on top of Canadian bacon.  Top with remaining Canadian bacon, scattering it evenly over muffin cubes.  Pour egg mixture over casserole.  Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours, to let bread absorb egg mixture.\r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees.\r\n\r\nRemove casserole from refrigerator, and uncover it.  Lightly sprinkle paprika evenly over top.  Cover casserole with foil and bake 40 minutes.  \r\n\r\nRemove dish from oven, remove foil, return dish to oven and continue to bake, uncovered, until the eggs are set and the bacon on top begins to crisp, about 20 minutes more.  Remove casserole from oven and let stand 5 minutes before serving.\r\n\r\nTo serve, cut casserole into squares and place on individual plates.  Spoon warm Hollandaise sauce over each serving just before serving.

Remove butter from microwave and stir until completely melted.\r\n\r\nSeparate eggs, placing yolks in small bowl and setting whites aside for another purpose.\r\n\r\nBeat yolks well with whisk or fork, then add to butter and stir well.  Add cream and lemon juice to egg mixture and stir well.  Microwave mixture, uncovered, on high, until just slightly thick, about 1 to 2 minutes, stopping every 20 seconds to stir with fork.\r\n\r\nRemove sauce from microwave and stir in mustard.  Makes about 1 1/2 cups.\r\n\r\nNote:  This sauce may be kept warm in a Thermos container up to 4 hours.  Or you can cool the sauce to room temperature and refrigerate it in a covered microwave-safe container for up to 24 hours.  To re-warm, cover the container with plastic wrap, pierce wrap with a knife to vent, and microwave on 50% power until heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to stir halfway through.  Do not allow sauce to boil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:  I haven't tried the above Hollandaise recipe.  I use the recipe under \"sauces.\"",

Do not try to remake more that 8 cups of jam or jelly at one time.  If Trial Batch sets satisfactorily, follow recipe above, using the listed measures of sugar, lemon juice and Certo Fruit Pectin for EACH 1 cup of jam or jelly.
